# Pokemon-Catcher
This is a simple and fun React based web application in which users can perform CRUD operations for trainers and catch or release pokemons.

## Package setup

Navigate to `/client` and `/server` and run `npm install` or `npm install --force` to install the required dependencies on both the client and server-side of the project.

## Run the application

From here, you can run 'npm start' in the `/client` folder to start the react app (http://localhost:3000/) and `npm start` in the `/server` folder to begin the server (http://localhost:3001/)
